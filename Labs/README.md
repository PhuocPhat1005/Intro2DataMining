# DATA MINING LABS
* This is the lab that helps me understand more about the algorithms in `Classification` and `Clustering`
* This part consists of: 
    * [Lab01 - Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/PhuocPhat1005/Intro2DataMining/tree/main/Labs/Lab1)
    * [Lab02 - Classification](https://github.com/PhuocPhat1005/Intro2DataMining/tree/main/Labs/Lab2)
    * [Lab03 - Clustering](https://github.com/PhuocPhat1005/Intro2DataMining/tree/main/Labs/Lab3)
